# Zero-Day-Ransomware-Bypass-All-EDR-s

Zero-Day Ransomware Bypass Simulation
Overview

This repository provides a controlled research environment for studying how zero-day ransomware samples can evade traditional EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response) systems.
The objective is to assist cybersecurity researchers, security engineers, and red team developers in understanding advanced evasion techniques so they can build stronger, AI-driven defense mechanisms.

This project is part of an ongoing effort to improve modern threat detection frameworks, particularly against unknown or adaptive malware strains that exploit zero-day vulnerabilities.

Educational Purpose
This repository serves as an academic and research tool for:
1. Demonstrating the core principles of ransomware encryption and execution flows.
2. Exploring common EDR evasion tactics, such as memory-based execution and API-level obfuscation.
3. Developing and testing new behavioral detection strategies in sandbox environments.
4. Training AI models to recognize advanced evasion patterns and zero-day activity traces.

Key Features
1. Analysis of common EDR detection weaknesses under simulated conditions.
2. Controlled execution of ransomware-like processes for testing defensive algorithms.
3. Modular framework for extending new obfuscation or detection methods.
4. Integration examples for testing AI-based detection tools against evasive threats.

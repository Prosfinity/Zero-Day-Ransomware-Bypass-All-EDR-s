# Zero-Day-Ransomware-Bypass-All-EDR-s
This repository demonstrates techniques used by advanced zero-day ransomware to evade traditional Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) systems.   The purpose of this project is purely educational — to help security researchers, analysts, and defensive developers understand modern evasion mechanisms and improve threat detection strategies.
